# Survival Game
My game is mostly TEXT-BASED. It's a survival game where the player travels with two other characters to travel from point A to point B with limited supplies. I plan on making the screen just a map with boxes (4x4), and the player can chose to move from their place up, down, left, or right. There will be events that happen when the player moves. There will be certain choices (i.e. to take risks and travel across steep rivers, etc.) and it will be a very short game. It's almost like a board game, however, because the map and events will never change (just to reduce the amount of code because I'm using PyGame).
