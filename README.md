# STORY
It's been months since a vrius spread. People who were infected died within hours, or at most, a few days, later. People's greed turned nearly everyone against each other. The group that you were once with has recently turned against you in order to maintain more supplies. Your two good friends decide to join you, staying loyal to you. The group sent the three of you off with minimal supplies to survive about five days, yet no map. One of your friends point out that they know of another base from radio transmissions. However, since there is no map, you and your friends must blindly travel together, hoping to come across the base.



## Survival Game

My game is mostly TEXT-BASED. It's a survival game where the player travels with two other characters to travel from point A to point B with limited supplies. I plan on making the screen just the text with a few buttons, varying on how many options there are, or a text box to input a number for that voice. Since I realized how difficult my game actually is, I had to remove many aspects of my code that I was excited for.
(EDIT 5/27/18) : I've decided to just revise my code and create dictionaries and choices based on what's true or false in the dictionary INSTEAD of learning a whole new branch off of python (GUIs like PyGame and Kivy).
