# STORY
It's been months since a vrius spread. People who were infected died within hours, or at most, a few days, later. People's greed turned nearly everyone against each other. The group that you were once with has recently turned against you in order to maintain more supplies. Your two good friends decide to join you, staying loyal to you. The group sent the three of you off with minimal supplies to survive about five days, and a map. One of your friends point out that they know of another base from radio transmissions. However, at the end of the next month, they are no longer taking any newcomers. Your goal is to survive the journey to the base under two months.



## Survival Game

My game is mostly TEXT-BASED. It's a survival game where the player travels with two other characters to travel from point A to point B with limited supplies. I plan on making the screen just a map with boxes (4x4), and the player can chose to move from their place up, down, left, or right. There will be events that happen when the player moves. There will be certain choices (i.e. to take risks and travel across steep rivers, etc.) and it will be a very short game. It's almost like a board game, however, because the map and events will never change (just to reduce the amount of code because I'm using PyGame).

The game will end automatically after 56* days.
