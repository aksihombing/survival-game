# STORY
It's been months since a vrius spread. People who were infected died within hours, or at most, a few days, later. People's greed turned nearly everyone against each other. The group that you were once with has recently turned against you in order to maintain more supplies. Your two good friends decide to join you, staying loyal to you. The group sent the three of you off with minimal supplies to survive about five days, yet no map. One of your friends point out that they know of another base from radio transmissions. However, since there is no map, you and your friends must blindly travel together, hoping to come across the base. Also, the base, according to the radio transmissions, will also close under two months.



## Survival Game

My game is mostly TEXT-BASED. It's a survival game where the player travels with two other characters to travel from point A to point B with limited supplies. I plan on making the screen just a map with boxes (4x4), and the player can chose to move from their place up, down, left, or right. There will be events that happen when the player moves. There will be certain choices (i.e. to take risks and travel across steep rivers, etc.) and it will be a very short game. It's almost like a board game, however, because the map and events will never change (just to reduce the amount of code because I'm using PyGame).

The game will end automatically after 56* days.

EDIT(5/9/19): Since I realized my project seems way too complicated with the board, I plan on changing my original plan IF I think it will take too long. I will be making it entirely text base, with direction choice with only one series of directions that will lead you to the base. Also, instead of PyGame, I might use Kivy (probably because I'm more familar with it ever since the short lesson).
